## **🎯 Introduction**

- So far, we have created **REST APIs** and connected them with an **in-memory database (H2)**.
- Now, we will move to a **real database** – **MySQL**.
- **Why MySQL?**
    - **H2 database** is great for development but **not used in production**.
    - **MySQL** is an **industry-standard relational database**.
    - Learning to use **MySQL** helps in understanding **real-world application development**.

## **📌 What We Will Cover in This Module**

✅ **Installing MySQL**  
✅ **Installing & Using DBeaver** (A database management tool)  
✅ **Understanding how Spring Data JPA interacts with databases**  
✅ **Performing CRUD operations on MySQL**

# **🛠 Installing MySQL**

## **📌 Why Install MySQL?**

- In production, we don't use **in-memory databases** like **H2**.
- We need a **real database** that stores data **persistently**.
- MySQL is a widely used **SQL-based relational database**.

## **📌 Installation Process**

### **🔹 Mac Installation (Using Homebrew)**

1️⃣ **Install Homebrew**

- Homebrew is a **package manager** for macOS.
- It helps install various **developer tools**, including MySQL.
- If not installed, follow online resources to install it.

2️⃣ **Install MySQL using Homebrew**

```Plain
sh
CopyEdit
brew install mysql

```

3️⃣ **Start MySQL Server**

```Plain
sh
CopyEdit
brew services start mysql

```

4️⃣ **Access MySQL CLI (Command-Line Interface)**

```Plain
sh
CopyEdit
mysql -u root -p

```

- `**u root**` → Username (`root` by default).
- `**p**` → Prompts for the password.

5️⃣ **Secure MySQL Installation**

- By default, the MySQL database is **not secured**.
- Run the following command to **set up security configurations**:
    
    ```Plain
    sh
    CopyEdit
    mysql_secure_installation
    
    ```
    
- This will prompt you to **set a password** for MySQL.

### **🔹 Windows Installation**

1️⃣ **Download MySQL Installer**

- Go to **[MySQL official website](https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/installer/)**.
- Download the **MySQL Server** installer.

2️⃣ **Choose Components to Install**

- You can install **only the MySQL server** or **additional tools** like:
    - **MySQL Workbench** (GUI for managing MySQL).
    - **MySQL Connector** (for connecting applications with MySQL).

3️⃣ **Follow Installation Steps**

- The installer will guide you through setting up MySQL.
- It may also **install additional software**.

4️⃣ **Using MySQL Workbench**

- Windows users can use **MySQL Workbench** instead of **DBeaver**.
- However, **DBeaver is preferred** as it is widely used in the industry.

# **🔍 Installing & Using DBeaver**

## **📌 What is DBeaver?**

- **DBeaver** is a **GUI-based tool** for managing databases.
- It supports **multiple databases** like MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle, etc.
- Helps in **writing queries, analyzing data, and managing tables**.

## **📌 Installation Process**

1️⃣ **Download DBeaver**

- Visit **DBeaver official website**.
- Download the version based on your **Operating System**:
    - Windows ✅
    - macOS ✅
    - Linux ✅

2️⃣ **Install & Open DBeaver**

- Follow standard installation steps.
- Once installed, **open the application**.

# **🖥 Connecting MySQL with DBeaver**

## **🔗 Steps to Connect Local MySQL Database**

1️⃣ **Open DBeaver**

2️⃣ **Create a New Database Connection**

- Click on **New Database Connection**.
- Select **MySQL** from the list of databases.  
    3️⃣ **Enter Connection Details**
- **Server:** `localhost`
- **Port:** `3306` (default MySQL port)
- **Username:** `root`
- **Password:** _(Enter the password you set earlier)_  
    4️⃣ **Click Finish**
- The connection is now established.

# **🛠 Working with Databases in DBeaver**

## **📌 Exploring Databases**

- Once connected, you will see all **databases listed** in DBeaver.
- You can **create, modify, and delete tables**.
- It allows executing **SQL queries**.

## **📌 Running Queries**

1️⃣ **Open SQL Editor**

- Click on **SQL Editor** in DBeaver.  
    2️⃣ **Run a Simple Query**

```SQL
sql
CopyEdit
SELECT * FROM test.employee;

```

- This retrieves all records from the `employee` table.

# **⚡️ Key Takeaways**

✅ **MySQL** is an industry-standard relational database used in real-world applications.

✅ **Homebrew (Mac)** and **MySQL Installer (Windows)** can be used for installation.

✅ **DBeaver** is a powerful tool for managing databases and writing queries.

✅ **Connecting MySQL to DBeaver** allows easy database management and query execution.

# **🔎 Summary for Quick Interview Revision**

1️⃣ **Why move from H2 to MySQL?**

- H2 is in-memory; MySQL stores data persistently.
- MySQL is widely used in production.

2️⃣ **How to install MySQL?**

- **Mac:** `brew install mysql`
- **Windows:** Download **MySQL Installer**.

3️⃣ **How to start MySQL server?**

```Plain
sh
CopyEdit
brew services start mysql   # (Mac)

```

4️⃣ **How to secure MySQL?**

```Plain
sh
CopyEdit
mysql_secure_installation

```

- Sets **password protection**.

5️⃣ **How to connect MySQL with DBeaver?**
