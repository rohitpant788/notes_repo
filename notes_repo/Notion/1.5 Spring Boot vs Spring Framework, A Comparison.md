# **Spring Boot vs Spring Framework: Understanding the Differences**

_Spring Boot simplifies application development by providing auto-configuration, embedded servers, and dependency management, reducing boilerplate code._

---

## **📌 Spring Boot & Spring Framework Overview**

- **Spring Framework** was created in **2003** by _Roger Johnson_ to provide a modular framework for Java applications.
- **Spring Boot** was developed in **2014** by _VMware_ to simplify Spring applications with features like **auto-configuration** and **starter dependencies**.
- Spring Boot is built **on top of** Spring Framework, offering additional functionalities.

📢 **Key Takeaway**:

➡ Spring Boot **removes** the need for manual configurations and makes microservice development easier.

## **🚀 Key Differences Between Spring Boot and Spring Framework**

### **1️⃣ Starter Dependencies in Spring Boot**

🔹 Spring Boot introduces **starter dependencies** to simplify project setup.

🔹 **Spring Framework does not** include starter dependencies, requiring manual dependency management.

🔹 Example:

- **Spring Boot Starter Web Dependency** → Provides built-in support for web applications.
- **Spring Boot Starter Test Dependency** → Supports testing with pre-configured settings.
- **Spring Initializer** → Allows adding dependencies easily while creating a project.

📢 **Advantage**:

✔ **Reduces boilerplate code** by providing pre-configured dependencies.

---

### **2️⃣ Auto-Configuration in Spring Boot**

🔹 One of the most powerful features of Spring Boot.

🔹 Automatically configures dependencies based on what is available in the **classpath**.

🔹 Example Workflow:

1. Add a **dependency** in `pom.xml`.
2. **Maven** adds it to the **classpath**.
3. Spring Boot **auto-configures** the application using predefined configurations.

📢 **Key Point**:

✔ **Spring Boot loads configuration files automatically**, whereas in Spring Framework, developers must manually configure each setting.

📌 **Behind the Scenes**:

- Spring Boot has a package: `spring-boot-autoconfigure`
- Inside it, there is a **meta-inf** folder that contains:
    - **Auto-configuration imports** → Defines which configurations should be loaded.
    - **Conditional configuration classes** → Load only if specific conditions are met (e.g., a bean is missing).

📢 **Advantage**:

✔ **Simplifies project setup** without needing to write complex configuration files.

🔜 Auto-configuration will be covered **in the next lecture** in greater detail.

### **3️⃣ Externalized Configuration**

🔹 Spring Boot allows configurations to be **externalized** using different property files.

🔹 Common property sources:

- **application.properties**
- **Environment variables**
- **Command-line arguments**
- **YAML files**

🔹 **Spring Boot can load configurations from multiple sources**, whereas in Spring Framework, configuration files need to be explicitly defined.

📢 **Advantage**:

✔ Developers can use **one codebase** to support **multiple configurations** dynamically.

---

### **4️⃣ Embedded Servers (Tomcat & Jetty)**

🔹 **Spring Boot provides built-in servers**, while Spring Framework requires manual configuration.

🔹 Example:

- If `spring-boot-starter-web` is added, it **automatically** includes **Tomcat**.
- Inside `pom.xml`, the **Spring Boot starter web dependency** adds:
    - Embedded **Tomcat** or **Jetty**.
    - **Spring Web MVC** dependency.

📢 **Advantage**:

✔ **No need to manually configure an external server**—Spring Boot applications run **independently**.

---

### **5️⃣ Built-in Metrics & Health Checks (Spring Boot Actuators)**

🔹 **Spring Boot Actuator** provides **pre-built** endpoints for monitoring application health.

🔹 Example:

- `/actuator/health` → Checks application health.
- `/actuator/metrics` → Provides system metrics.

🔹 **Spring Framework does not provide these built-in monitoring features**—developers must create endpoints manually.

📢 **Advantage**:

✔ **Production-ready monitoring with zero additional coding.**

---

### **6️⃣ Dependency Management (Spring Boot Starter Parent)**

🔹 **Spring Boot manages dependency versions** via **Spring Boot Starter Parent**.

🔹 Inside `pom.xml`:

```XML
xml
CopyEdit
<parent>
    <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
    <artifactId>spring-boot-starter-parent</artifactId>
    <version>3.3.2</version>
</parent>

```

🔹 Benefits:

- **No need to manage version conflicts manually**.
- **All dependencies are compatible** with the parent version.

📢 **Advantage**:

✔ Developers **only specify dependencies**, and Spring Boot **resolves version conflicts** automatically.

## **✨ Why Developers Prefer Spring Boot?**

- ✅ **Eliminates boilerplate code** – Focus on **business logic**.
- ✅ **Pre-configured dependencies** – No manual setup required.
- ✅ **Auto-configuration** – Saves time by reducing XML-based configuration.
- ✅ **Embedded servers** – No need to install and configure Tomcat/Jetty manually.
- ✅ **Actuators for monitoring** – Easy **health checks** and **metrics**.
- ✅ **Simplified dependency management** – **Spring Boot Starter Parent** handles versions.
- ✅ **Microservices-friendly** – Ideal for **modern distributed applications**.
