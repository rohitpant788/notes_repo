## **🔹 Introduction to Maven**

Maven is a **build automation** and **project management** tool for Java applications. It plays a crucial role in **dependency management**, **build automation**, and **deployment**.

### **📢 Key Takeaways:**

✅ Maven is not specific to Spring Boot; it works for any Java project.

✅ It helps manage dependencies and automates project builds.

✅ Applications can be **packaged**, **tested**, and **deployed** using Maven.

✅ Maven Central Repository hosts various dependencies that can be pulled into projects.

---

## **🔹 Maven as a Chef 🍽️ (Analogy)**

Think of Maven as a **chef** who wants to cook a dish.

- **Recipe (pom.xml)** → Defines what is needed.
- **Ingredients (Dependencies)** → Pulled from Maven repositories.
- **Final Dish (Packaged Application - JAR/WAR)** → Built and ready for deployment.

Maven **orchestrates** everything: it **fetches dependencies**, **compiles code**, **runs tests**, and **packages the project** for deployment.

---

## **🔹 What is** `**pom.xml**`**?**

POM = **Project Object Model** (An XML file that contains project configurations).

### **📢 What does** `**pom.xml**` **define?**

- **Java version**
- **Dependencies (Libraries used in the project)**
- **Plugins**
- **Repositories (like Maven Central)**
- **Project metadata**

Developers specify dependencies in `pom.xml`, and **Maven handles everything else**.

---

## **🔹 Maven's Role in Dependency Management**

✅ **Automatic dependency resolution** – No need to manually download JARs.

✅ **Transitive dependencies** – If dependency A requires dependency B, Maven fetches both.

✅ **Versioning & Conflict Resolution** – Handles different versions of dependencies.

📌 **Example**: Spring Boot starter dependencies (`spring-boot-starter-web`, etc.) are all managed in `pom.xml` via Maven.

---

## **🔹 Maven Build Automation 🔄**

Maven automates the entire **build process**, including:

✅ Compilation

✅ Testing

✅ Packaging

✅ Deployment

💡 **Maven Build Lifecycle:**

Each phase in Maven's build lifecycle is called a **goal**.

### **📢 Maven Build Phases (Goals)**

|   |   |
|---|---|
|Phase|Description|
|`validate`|Checks if project structure and dependencies are correct.|
|`compile`|Compiles Java source files.|
|`test`|Runs unit tests using JUnit/TestNG.|
|`package`|Creates a JAR/WAR file.|
|`install`|Installs JAR/WAR into the local repository.|
|`deploy`|Deploys packaged application to a remote repository.|

---

## **🔹 Running Maven Commands in Terminal**

### **1️⃣ Compiling Code**

```Plain
sh
CopyEdit
./mvnw compile

```

🔹 This compiles the Java code and generates `.class` files in the `target` folder.

---

### **2️⃣ Creating a JAR/WAR File**

```Plain
sh
CopyEdit
./mvnw package

```

🔹 Packages the application as a JAR or WAR file.

📌 **Example Output:**

```Plain
sh
CopyEdit
target/Introduction-to-SpringBoot-0.0.2.jar

```

This JAR file can now be shared and executed.

---

### **3️⃣ Running the Packaged JAR File**

```Plain
sh
CopyEdit
java -jar target/Introduction-to-SpringBoot-0.0.2.jar

```

✅ If Java is installed, this will **start the Spring Boot application**.

---

### **4️⃣ Cleaning Build Files**

```Plain
sh
CopyEdit
./mvnw clean

```

✅ Deletes previous build files (removes `target/` folder).

---

### **5️⃣ Running Tests**

```Plain
sh
CopyEdit
./mvnw test

```

✅ Runs test cases.

📌 **Example Test Output:**

```Plain
sh
CopyEdit
1 test passed!

```

---

### **6️⃣ Installing the JAR Locally**

```Plain
sh
CopyEdit
./mvnw install

```

✅ Installs the JAR in the **local Maven repository**, making it available for other projects.

---

### **7️⃣ Deploying to a Remote Repository**

```Plain
sh
CopyEdit
./mvnw deploy

```

✅ Deploys the built project to **Maven Central** or other repositories.

---

## **🔹 Running the Spring Boot Application with Maven**

Instead of using `java -jar`, we can use:

```Plain
sh
CopyEdit
./mvnw spring-boot:run

```

✅ This will start the Spring Boot application.

---

## **🔹 Creating a Docker Image with Maven**

Maven can also be used to build **Docker images** for deployment.

```Plain
sh
CopyEdit
./mvnw spring-boot:build-image

```

🚀 **Docker support** will be covered later in the course.
