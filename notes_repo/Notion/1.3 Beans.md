## **🌱 What Are Beans?**

- **Beans** are the **core building blocks** of a Spring application.
- Spring **manages their lifecycle and dependencies**, so we **don’t have to create objects manually** using the `new` keyword.
- They are **instantiated, assembled, and managed** by the **Spring IoC (Inversion of Control) container**.
- **Every Spring Boot application consists of beans** that interact with each other.

### **💡 Why Are Beans Important?**

- They **eliminate the need for manual object creation**.
- Enable **Dependency Injection (DI)**, which improves code maintainability and testability.
- Reduce **memory management complexity** by **delegating object creation** to Spring.

## **🛠️ Creating Objects in Java vs Spring Boot Beans**

### **👉 Traditional Java Object Creation**

```Java
java
CopyEdit
public class Car {
    private String model;
    public Car(String model) {
        this.model = model;
    }
}

// Creating an object manually using 'new'
Car car = new Car("Tesla");

```

- Uses `**new**` **keyword** to create an object.
- Developer **manages the object lifecycle manually**.
- Not scalable for large applications.

### **👉 Spring Boot Approach (Bean)**

```Java

@Component
public class Car {
    public Car() {
        System.out.println("Car bean is created!");
    }
}

```

```Java

@Autowired
private Car car; // No need to use 'new'! Spring injects the bean automatically

```

- Spring **automatically creates and manages objects**.
- **No need to use** `**new**` **keyword**.
- **Beans are injected wherever needed**.

## **📝 Official Definition of a Bean**

> "A bean is a managed object that is instantiated, assembled, and managed by the Spring IoC container."

- Example: A **Car bean** might need dependencies like **engine, model, and color**.
- The **Spring framework manages all these dependencies** for us.

---

## **🔥 Ways to Define Beans in Spring Boot**

### **1️⃣ Using** `**@Component**` **(Stereotype Annotations)**

```Java

@Component
public class Apple {
    public void eatApple() {
        System.out.println("Eating an apple 🍏");
    }
}

```

- Marks the **class as a Spring bean**.
- **Spring scans and registers** this bean automatically.

### **📌 Other Stereotype Annotations**

|   |   |
|---|---|
|Annotation|Purpose|
|`@Component`|Generic bean declaration|
|`@Service`|Declares a **service layer** component|
|`@Repository`|Declares a **repository (DAO) layer**|
|`@Controller`|Declares a **controller (MVC)**|

---

### **2️⃣ Using** `**@Configuration**` **and** `**@Bean**`

```Java

@Configuration
public class AppConfig {
    @Bean
    public Apple apple() {
        return new Apple();
    }
}

```

- **Explicitly declares beans** inside a configuration class.
- Used when we **want more control over bean creation**.

---

## **💡 Bean Lifecycle in Spring Boot**

Beans go through **several stages** during their lifecycle:

### **🔄 Lifecycle Stages**

1️⃣ **Bean Creation**

- The bean is **instantiated** by Spring.

2️⃣ **Dependency Injection**

- Spring **injects dependencies** into the bean.

3️⃣ **Bean Initialization (**`**@PostConstruct**`**)**

- Called **after** the bean is created & dependencies are injected.

4️⃣ **Bean Usage**

- The bean is **actively used** in the application.

5️⃣ **Bean Destruction (**`**@PreDestroy**`**)**

- Called **before the application shuts down**.

### **👀 Example: Using** `**@PostConstruct**` **&** `**@PreDestroy**`

```Java

@Component
public class Apple {
    @PostConstruct
    public void beforeUse() {
        System.out.println("🍏 Apple bean is ready to use!");
    }

    @PreDestroy
    public void beforeDestroy() {
        System.out.println("🚮 Apple bean is being destroyed!");
    }
}

```

**🔹 Output:**

```Plain
🍏 Apple bean is ready to use!
(Eating apple...)
🚮 Apple bean is being destroyed!

```

## **🌀 Bean Scopes in Spring Boot**

Defines **how beans are created and managed**.

|   |   |
|---|---|
|Scope|Description|
|`singleton`|**(Default)** One instance shared across the entire application|
|`prototype`|New bean instance is created **each time it is requested**|
|`request`|A **new bean** is created for **every HTTP request**|
|`session`|A **new bean** is created for **each user session**|
|`websocket`|A **new bean** is created per WebSocket connection|

### **🛠️ Example: Singleton vs Prototype**

```Java
java
CopyEdit
@Component
@Scope("singleton") // Default behavior
public class Apple { ... }

```

```Java
java
CopyEdit
@Component
@Scope("prototype") // Creates a new bean each time
public class Orange { ... }

```

**📌 Singleton (Default)**

```Java
java
CopyEdit
@Autowired
private Apple apple1;

@Autowired
private Apple apple2;

// Both references will be the same!

```

**📌 Prototype**

```Java
java
CopyEdit
@Autowired
private Orange orange1;

@Autowired
private Orange orange2;

// Both references will be different!

```

## **🚀 Key Takeaways**

✅ **Beans are managed objects** that Spring Boot **instantiates, assembles, and manages**.

✅ **Spring Boot automatically injects beans**, so we **don’t need to use** `**new**` **keyword**.

✅ **Stereotype annotations (**`**@Component**`**,** `**@Service**`**,** `**@Repository**`**,** `**@Controller**`**)** help register beans automatically.

✅ **Beans follow a lifecycle** (`@PostConstruct` and `@PreDestroy` can be used to hook into it).

✅ **Beans can have different scopes**, but **singleton** is the default.

## **🎯 Quick Interview Revision**

### **Q1: What is a Bean in Spring Boot?**

- A managed object **instantiated, assembled, and maintained** by the **Spring IoC container**.

### **Q2: How do you define a Bean?**

- **Using** `**@Component**` **annotation**.
- **Using** `**@Bean**` **inside a** `**@Configuration**` **class**.

### **Q3: What is the default scope of a Bean?**

- `**singleton**` – only **one instance** of the bean is created and shared.

### **Q4: What are different bean scopes?**

- **singleton** (default), **prototype**, **request**, **session**, **websocket**.

### **Q5: What are** `**@PostConstruct**` **and** `**@PreDestroy**`**?**

- `@PostConstruct`: **Executed after the bean is created**.
- `@PreDestroy`: **Executed before the bean is destroyed**.
